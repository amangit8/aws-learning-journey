## Day 3 â€“ AWS Metered Billing & Innovation Waves

## Metered Billing
- AWS charges on a **pay-as-you-go** model (like electricity or water).
- No upfront fixed costs, only pay for what you use.
- **Main billing factors:**
  - Compute time (e.g., EC2 instance hours)
  - Storage (e.g., GBs in S3)
  - Data transfer (outbound traffic)
- **Free Tier examples:**
  - EC2 t2.micro: 750 hours/month (12 months)
  - S3: 5GB free storage
  - Lambda: 1M requests free per month

## Innovation Waves
- Cloud computing drives rapid **innovation cycles**.
- Businesses can experiment and scale fast without huge upfront investment.
- Companies save time + money, reinvest faster, and stay competitive.
